1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
---> Boolean Data Type : 1] True
                    2] False
                    a = True
                    b = False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
---> 1] AND
     2] OR
     3] NOT
3. Make a list of each Boolean operators truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
--->  1]AND
      input     |   output
     A     B    |    A.B
     -----------|--------
     0     0    |    0
     0     1    |    0
     1     0    |    0
     1     1    |    1
     
     2] OR
      input     |   output
      A    B    |    A+B
     -----------|------------
      0    0    |    0
      0    1    |    1
      1    0    |    1
      1    1    |    1
     3] NOT
         input  | output
          A     |   B
         -------|-----
          0     |   1
          1     |   0
          


5. What are the six comparison operators?
--->1] Equal : x == y	
    2] Not Equal : x!=y
    3] Greater than :x > y	
    4] Less than : x < y
    5] Greater than or equal to : x >= y	
    6] Less than or equal to :	x <= y
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
---> = : It is an assignment operator. , == : It is a relational or comparison operator.
     + : if want to store data that time we use assignment operator. == : if I try to compare variable a variable and b variable that time i use '==' (a==b)

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
  print('eggs')
  if spam > 5:
      print('bacon')
  else:
      print('ham')
      print('spam')
print('spam')
--->print('eggs')
    if spam == 10:
      print('bacon')
    else:
      print('ham')
      print('spam')
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
--->spam = int(input("Enter a Value :  "))
    if spam == 1:
        print('Hello')
    elif spam == 2:
        print('Howdy')
    else:
        print("Greeting!")
 
 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
 ---> Ctrl + C
 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
 ---> 1] Break : Stop the loop in which the statement is Placed.
         if i have list , i want to stop a program after second item .
      2] Continue : skips a single iteration in loop.
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
---> 1] range(10) : generate number from 0 to 9
     2] range(0,10) : generate number from 0 to 9, but if i will give range(5,10) then it will generate number between 5 to 9  
     3]range(0,10,1) : here 0 is starting 10 ending and 1 is step size. other than 1 i will give 2 then i will generate number like [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
---> for loop : for i in range(0,11):
                    print(i)
