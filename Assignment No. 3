1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
---> using function i can run same program muliple time,
     We break long program in multiple small function.
     Function can share with another ,
     Functions can be shared and used by other programmers.
2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it't is called?
---> When a function is called and starts executing the function
3. What statement creates a function?
---> 'def' keyworld create a function.
4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
---> function contain some instruction and i want get benefit from function that time i will use function call.
5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
---> def fun():
          x = 2022
          return x
     here x is local scope, x can only use inside a function
     ----------------------------------------------------------
     x = 200
     def func1():
        print(x)
        def func2():
            y = x + 1
            print(y)
